    longDefinition:
      "MRR represents the total revenue you can expect each month from 位活躍學員hip subscriptions. It excludes one-time purchases like class packs, drop-ins, retail, and workshops. MRR is the foundation of a sustainable studio business because it provides predictable cash flow.",
    calculation: "Sum of (monthly membership price × active subscribers)",
    example:
      "If you have 50 members paying $99/month and 30 members paying $149/month, your MRR = (50 × $99) + (30 × $149) = $9,420",

    term: "ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)",
    shortDefinition: "MRR multiplied by 12",
    longDefinition:
      "ARR is your MRR annualized, giving you a full-year view of your recurring revenue if current subscriptions remain constant. Useful for long-term planning and comparing year-over-year growth.",
    calculation: "MRR × 12",
    example: "If MRR is $14,100, then ARR = $14,100 × 12 = $169,200",

    term: "Revenue Per Student (RPS)",
    shortDefinition: "Average revenue generated per active student",
    longDefinition:
      "This metric shows how much revenue, on average, each active student contributes. Rising RPS indicates students are purchasing higher-value plans, attending more often, or buying additional products/services. It's a key indicator of customer value.",
    calculation: "Total Revenue ÷ Active Students",
    example:
      "If total revenue is $18,400 and you have 163 active students, RPS = $18,400 ÷ 163 = $113",

    longDefinition:
      "Gross margin shows what percentage of revenue remains after paying direct costs like instructor pay, credit card fees, and class materials. A healthy yoga studio typically targets 60-70% gross margin. Lower margins may indicate overstaffing or underpricing.",
    calculation: "(Revenue - Direct Costs) ÷ Revenue × 100",
    example:
      "Revenue of $18,400 with $5,900 in direct costs gives (18,400 - 5,900) ÷ 18,400 × 100 = 68% margin",

      "CAC includes all marketing spend, promotions, referral bonuses, and sales efforts divided by new students acquired. A healthy CLV:CAC ratio is 3:1 or higher, meaning lifetime value is at least 3x the cost to acquire.",
    calculation: "Total Acquisition Spend ÷ 新學員s Acquired",
    example:
      "If you spent $800 on marketing and acquired 10 new members, CAC = $800 ÷ 10 = $80",

    shortDefinition: "Percentage of students who remain active over time",
    longDefinition:
      "Retention rate measures how well you keep students engaged. 30-day retention tracks students who return within 30 days of their last visit. 90-day and annual retention give longer-term views. High retention reduces the need for constant new student acquisition.",
    calculation: "(Students at End - 新學員s) ÷ Students at Start × 100",
    example:
      "Started month with 150 members, ended with 158, added 12 new → (158 - 12) ÷ 150 × 100 = 97.3% retention",

      "Churn is the opposite of retention - the rate at which students leave. Monthly churn of 5% means losing 5% of your base each month. Reducing churn by even 1-2% has compounding benefits on long-term revenue.",
    calculation: "Lost Students ÷ Starting Students × 100",

    longDefinition:
      "The engagement score combines visit frequency, recency, class variety, and social interactions (referrals, community posts) into a single number. Scores above 70 indicate highly engaged members. Below 40 suggests intervention needed.",
    calculation: "Weighted combination of frequency, recency, variety, and social factors",
